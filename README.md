# core_curriculum
This is a help tool for core curriculum assignment.

I implemented following functions. 
- check duplication,
- check abnormal data exist or not,
- list up not filled desired order, and 
- reconstruct desired order according to term. 


## usage 
This usage is written for user who uses MacOS.
Please follow the following steps, 
- download data typing "git clone https://github.com/toshiakiasakura/core_curriculum " in terminal, 
- fill your desired order, and put that data where appropriate, 
    ("./dt/***" is recommended), 
- change the path of "original" in "pathList.py", 
- open jupyter notebook and select "reconstruction.ipynb", and 
- run all. 

## Attention 
- Do not add or delete any rows and columns. 
- Do not change "病院診療科リスト", I exploit list of data from it. 
- Since I'm Group E, there may be any error. <br>
    If any error occurs, please inform me. I will fix bugs. 

I have some ideas of helpful functions, and <br>
want to implement them as everyone (ofcourse,who can not use python),<br>
can use these tools. If you want to collaborate with me, <br> 
please contact me. 

Note: I would not help set up of the environmnet of python during <br>
the course of this time.
